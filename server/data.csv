"If you are following along in 2021, the current version of d3 at the time this video was made is 5.14.1.  There were big changes in v6 that are described in the last video of the series.  A default install will install v6 which may or may not be 100% compatable and may cause some headaches if you try to follow along.<br>Also, he would have been using react 16.10.2.  I don&#39;t know if this will be as big of a problem.  React 16 doesn&#39;t require you to import React in app.js, for example.",0.0,0.029,0.971,29.905000000000005
