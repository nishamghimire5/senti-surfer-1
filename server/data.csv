after my last relationship I think that I would never fall in love again because my ex was my first love we were highschool sweethearts but she has fallen out of love on me so yeah and right now she has a new guy I hope they would be happy im their relationship. I hope that one day I would be able to love myself again and find someone who will love me for who I am.,0.191,0.214,0.595,33.82,Positive

"this song reminds me of my forever crush from high school. her dad was transferred... so she was new to our school... i was coming by my bicycle... I saw a beautiful long black hair ( her backside) spread like a waterfall falling in heaven... i crashed my bike into a small tree with spikes.... i was then rushed to medical room... my right hand was bandaged.. i came out of the med room and i saw her... i dont know why but when i saw her my jaws dropped, my heart started to beat harder and faster... it was like i saw my soulmate at the time... it always happened when i saw her... but unfortunately i didn&#39;t confessed my feelings to her... after the high school.. she went away.. i never saw again till now.. i dont know but she always gave me butterflies❤..",0.105,0.04,0.855,94.035,Positive
