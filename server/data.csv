"This is the first K-pop song I actually liked. 

Where do I start?

-that tone on your right earbud at 0:09 😌
-the first singer sounds like GLadOS from the Portal video game
-catchy 80s style beat, with just enough BPMs to keep you hooked
-the harmony is just absolutely 😚👌
-melody has just enough variations to not make it sound boring but not too much to make it sound complicated
-a lot of words compressed in each stanza (idk but there’s this research about pop songs where the more words there are per stanza the catchier and more ‘addictive’ the song gets)
-all the singers are at least bilingual
-the music profile is so melodically unique, that it’s hard to categorize this song as JUST a pop song. It’s way, way, way more than just a pop song
-production value is excellent for a relatively unknown label, it’s almost like these guys invented “indie” K-pop 

Overall, this song is amazing. I’m not a K-pop fan, more into 60s classical British rock & contemporary American folk.

But golly, this song is just beautiful.

Bonus: the backing harmony progression at 1:02 & 1:05, then the sudden ‘rap burst’ is just icing on the cake. This group is pure talent.",0.176,0.025,0.799,99.44999999999999,Positive
